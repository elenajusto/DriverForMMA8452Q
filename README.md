# DriverForMMA8452Q
Here is my first attempt at writing a hardware driver for the Arduino. 

Here I will be trying to write an Arduino driver for the Keyestudio MMA8452Q Module Triaxial Digital Acceleration Tilt Sensor.

The MMA8452Q Datasheet can be found here: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MMA8452Q.pdf

Goal #1:
- Be able to read from the sensor's I2C bus
- Be able to write to the sensor's I2C bus
- Read data from the X, Y and Z axis of the sensor

I don't think this will work, but here is attempt number one!
